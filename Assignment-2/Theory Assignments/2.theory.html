2.CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. They can target elements based on their type, class, id, attributes, and more. Here are some common types of selectors:

Element Selector: Selects elements by their tag name. For example, p selects all <p> elements.

Class Selector: Selects elements with a specific class attribute. It is denoted by a period (.) followed by the class name. For example, .classname selects all elements with class="classname".

ID Selector: Selects a single element with a specific id attribute. It is denoted by a hash (#) followed by the id name. For example, #idname selects the element with id="idname".

Attribute Selector: Selects elements based on the presence or value of a specific attribute. For example, [type="text"] selects all input elements with type="text".

Universal Selector: Selects all elements in the document. It is denoted by an asterisk (*). For example, * selects all elements.

Descendant Selector: Selects elements that are descendants of a specified element. For example, div p selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements.
