Block-Level Elements
 Definition:
A block-level element takes up the full width of its parent container, starting on a new line. It creates a "block" of content.

-> Always starts on a new line.

-> Expands the full width available (by default).

-> Can contain other block-level and inline elements.

 Example:

<div>,<p>,<h1> to <h6>,<section>,

<article>,<ul>, <ol>, <li>,<form>, <table>






Inline Elements
 Definition:
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. It flows within a block of text.

-> Stays on the same line as other content.

-> Only consumes as much horizontal space as its content requires.

-> Cannot contain block-level elements.


 Example: 

<span>

<a>

<strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>

<img>

<input>
