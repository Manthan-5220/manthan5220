3. CSS Box Model
The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree and consists of the following components:

Content: The innermost part where text and images appear. The size of the content area can be controlled using properties like width and height.

Padding: The space between the content and the border. Padding is transparent and can be set using properties like padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left.

Border: A border surrounds the padding (if any) and the content. It can be styled using properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color.
