1. Difference Between Inline, Internal, and External CSS
Inline CSS: This type of CSS is applied directly within an HTML element using the style attribute. It affects only that specific element. For example:

html

Run
Copy code
<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello World</h1>
Inline CSS is useful for quick styling but is not recommended for larger projects due to maintainability issues.

Internal CSS: This CSS is defined within a <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document. It applies to all elements within that document. For example:

html
7 lines
Click to expand
<head>
<style>
...
Internal CSS is useful for styling a single document without affecting others.

External CSS: This involves linking to a separate CSS file using the <link> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document. This method allows multiple HTML documents to share the same CSS file. For example:

html
3 lines
Click to expand
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
...
External CSS is the most efficient way to manage styles across multiple pages.
